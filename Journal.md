# What is Markdown?

## Overview

Markdown is comparable to HTML in that you can define the pages formatting through text based commands. The advantage however is the simplicity meaning that people with little training can create webpages, notes and emails using a lightweight and intuitive form.

## Features

To determine headlines a hashtag is placed before the text and the number of sequential hashtags determines how small the font is. 

Furthermore including image links is simply done by referencing the local copy after '![]'.

Bullet points are created using a dash like so:
	- Example Uno


To make pieces of text **BOLD** two astrisks are placed either side of the text.*Italics* however are made only using the one astrisk.
