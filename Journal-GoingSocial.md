In order to upload and download files from the Github rep. a push/ pull command is used in the terminal. 

To do this follow the steps below:

Pushing the entire contents of the local directory into the remote repo is achieved by using the following command. 

'git push -u origin' Where 'origin' is a user defined name for the remote
